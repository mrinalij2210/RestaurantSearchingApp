# RestaurantSearchingApp
This project lets a restaurant register / unregister with the app.
Allows users / customers to search for restaurants based on :
  1. Cuisine
  2. Budget per head
  3. Name of restaurant
  
The project uses the concept of hashish using chaining to store and map the restaurants.
There are different hash functions to search with the three categories mentioned above.
